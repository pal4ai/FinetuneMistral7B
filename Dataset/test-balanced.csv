The far right is afraid to compete with the best. Trump is the outcome of that inability to compete. Trump's ""take my marbles and go home"" plan is Herbert Hoover dished out all over again.

0	Agreed, to all of this.	golikehellmachine	politics	3	-1	-1	2016-11	1479314545	"You know one aspect that is present in all of all of the thinkpieces about the ""economic anxiety"" of the white middle class worker is that only the economical concerns of non-minorities are valid. Over a third of black people are under the poverty line yet nobody nobody cares about their concerns. LGBTQ folk experience unemployment at two to five times the rate of the general population yet nobody is defending LGBTQ people voting for Clinton because they don't want to be fired for having a picture of their lover in their wallet. People yell ""emails"" at a poor black person who is worried about losing their healthcare for their child if Clinton loses. People yell ""Benghazi"" at somebody who is afraid that if Clinton loses that they'll be fired if they try to get their spouse on their company's insurance policy. Where are the hand-wringing thinkpieces coming from the other side of the aisle for these groups? Where are the articles from conservatives saying ""hey, its great and all that you voted for Trump but its a scary time for some minorities who have a lot to lose so lets talk about their needs"" plastered all over the internet? Nowhere to be seen, because the suffering of minorities is a deliberate effect of the platform. Mexican immigrants, legal and illegal, failing to show up to work and losing their jobs to others because they're afraid of INS is the platform. Muslims too afraid to leave the house because of hateful violence is the platform. Trans women getting beat up in the bathroom is the platform. Gay couples having their children ripped away from them is the platform. I'd like to say that bigotry isn't representative of Republicans voters this election cycle but I certainly didn't see a demand in the primary for an experienced fiscal conservative who calls for empathy and wants to stop interfering in the lives of minorities to the detriment just to feed the bloodlust of others. No, what became popular was an openly corrupt, extraordinarily unqualified candidate who had nothing of any tangible value to say but called mexicans rapists. That is the guy who won the primary, landslide after landslide. Conscious hate and callous disregard for those unlike one's self drove Trump's popularity. I can't think of a better word to describe it than bigotry."

Paying taxes isn't slavery when you get a shit ton of benefits from doing so. However, the GOP wants to gut schools, social programs, and any other safety nets we have in society, so that future generations will be so stupid and under-served that they don't know better than to fall in line behind whatever their party says. Which sounds a lot more like slavery than paying some taxes so that dying people can get healthcare.

I guess I am becoming right leaning, because I don't recognize the democratic party at all right now. I was brought up valuing equality and reasonable discourse, facts and empathy. I'm able to distinguish between fascists and protesters. The fascists wore masks and carried baseball bats, and attacked people who attended the event to listen to a speaker. The protesters were the people milling around with bewildered looks and cameras, or singing and dancing. They're not as much at fault - but they allowed the fascists to take advantage of them to create chaos and violence - they are guilty of creating this environment. I mostly listen to NPR if i listen to the radio. I'll reaffirm my belief that Trump could be more gentle, but the majority of the growing up needs to happen on the left - the pundits, media, and officials and society itself.

Raise your hand if you think that Donnie-boy wasn't neck-deep in Russian hookers in Moscow, and raise your other hand if you think the FSB doesn't take the gift of *kompromat* he's giving them as the most obvious Intelligence Service lay-up of all time. We can now safely ignore anyone who has a hand up. If you think it's at all possible that the FSB arranged for the acquisition of said *kompromat*, do you think they'd go about it like amateurs and not make the situation as damaging as possible? *Of course* it's a 14-year-old that shows up at Donnie-boy's room. Or a pair of them, who are of course completely down for piss-play or any other kink you could name. And raise a hand if you don't think Mr. Pussygrabber was down for all of it.

If someone is sent back by immigration, the airline actually foots the bill for returning them. Also, the uncertainty cuts into the amount of passengers flying in the first place, which we already see happening. He is awful for that industry.

IronyIntended2	politics	3	-1	-1	2017-04	1491072171	If we (the public) know nothing about what is in this so-called political unmasking that has allegedly been spread around intelligence agencies, how exactly is that a Political motivated unmasking? Wouldn't it need to be used against the political opponent to be of any political gain? Especially during an opponents run for office? The only unmasking we know of is Flynn, and that was post election, he lied about it, and he just requested immunity which looks to me like the conversations are possibly criminal therfore the unmasking must have been for something other than politics. I mean, sure they shouldn't have been leaked but WTF is the logic here? There is an open FBI investigation going on.

P-Muns	politics	21	-1	-1	2017-03	1488541396	People are attempting to create a nefarious cloud due to their partisan worldview instead of looking at things from an objective perspective. He used his political funds (not Trumps as many people in this thread seem to be confused about) for travel and some expenses to the RNC, a political event relevant to his career as a politician, reelection, and fundraising for his potential campaigns as a Senator. This is 100% perfectly legitimate. During this trip, he engaged in many activities, including actives which focused on his own political aspirations relevant to his own political campaigns. He also spoke out in favor of Trump and while there spoke with the Russian ambassador at some point. There is no conflict here since he is not required to do nothing other than campaign or personal political actions when using these funds in the context of being in a location itself. He can't spend them specifically to engage in these actions, but if he goes to the RNC using these funds, he can still speak with people or do things that do not relate to his political career. Now if his entire trip had been pushing the Trump campaign, you might be able to make that argument, if the entire trip had been specifically to meet with the ambassador, you might have a point since he used the funds for something other than his political career specifically. However, the meeting is a fraction of his time on this trip, literally minutes out of days at a public event that many people, including ambassadors from all over the world, attended. His stumping for Trump can be passed off as cooperative campaigning relevant to his own personal political campaigns. This is literally nothing being blown up for the ignorant masses who apparently think when you spend money to fly somewhere using campaign funds, you can't do anything else during that time at all, not true in the slightest.

And that state's supreme court voted in favor of a recount multiple times. Yet the party of that candidate put up every road block possible to stall the recount, up to and including a fake protest to intimidate the recount. Then to top it all off they take the recount to the SCOTUS, where the majority of the justices were picked by the candidates dad, or his friends. And that court ends the recount, thus selecting who won.

Fight lies with facts, even if the lies have an easier time getting around. Censorship only emboldens those lies.

0	Well put.	SHOWME_WHATYOUGOT	politics	3	-1	-1	2017-03	1488978650	Tl;dr: If all of our societies achievements only benefit the owners utilizing that advancement, our society will collapse. Coming from a very not poor person, if I didn't catch some lucky breaks, I would very likely be poor. Some include: not getting fired / pulled over for a DUI during my heavy drinking days, landing jobs with flexible hours to obscure how flaky I am, not having had employers realize when I was taking stimulants all day / every day, etc.) I've succeeded not based on hard work, but on a number of factors that were not in my control: a suburban middle class upbringing, opportunity to use computers from a young age, a top tier high school, a guidance counselor convincing me to apply to a top tier school, getting into said school, having parents pay loans equivalent to 2 years salary to attend to said school, an astronomically absurd number of times a project I wasn't going to complete on time was pushed out, the absurd amount of straight up cheating I got away with on assignments, and much, much more. I can learn complex subjects very quickly, which surprisingly makes up for an insane level of procrastination (like, skipping class all semester and study the nights before tests and get a good grade, or wait until the last night, around 1am,to start a 20 page grad school research paper level of procrastination). If one or two of those lucky breaks didn't work out, or if I were missing one or two key traits I rely on to scrape by, I'd be an intelligent, nice drug addict without a home, hounded by people who would rather lock me up than help me, in a country thinking I don't deserve help otherwise I wouldn't be poor. I truly hope something never happens to you that causes you to lose everything, but can you not empathize with those that have? Can't you look back at your life and see that if someone things went a little differently, they you could be in the same position as those who you think deserve to suffer? Even a drug addicted, lazy and contemptible person suffering from poverty doesn't deserve it. Someone you consider lazy or a drug addict my have severe anxiety or other disorders. Someone who seems to be hateful may be that way after years of abuse, bad luck, and the world treating them like shit. I'm sure there are some people who intend to game the system and get by with as little work as possible, but I'm certain you are overestimating how significantly that contributes to our problem with poverty. Poverty is primarily the result of people building on our collective resources and intelligence over centuries, while an incredibly disproportionate amount of the benefit of that work goes to the owner of that labor. The result is a negative feedback cycle. Instead of the progress of our society improving the quality of life of the society, it's only doing so for a small portion. Which means people need to work as much as before or more to maintain a decent quality of life, some at the same time, our jobs shift increasingly towards those that require greater skills and higher intelligence. Progress gets continually harder and if the benefits are the same, more and more people will not be intellectually, educationally, or mentally capable to contribute to our economy. Not far from now, a talented developer will have no use as taking the next steps forward in computer science will require genius level intellect. People work to make expensive tasks automated, and when they are no longer needed, the capital owners reap the benefits, the worker is let go, and the next task that needs automation is now beyond their capacity. When we develop driverless cars, the expectation will be that commuters now can dedicate that much more time to working. When robots are capable enough, they won't be helping people improve their quality of life. They will replace people's jobs and those responsible for building this technology will not benefit from it. If we want to sustain this country and our economy, it's far past the time that everyone who contributed to what we've achieved sees some benefit. The wealthy aren't richer now than ever because they are working harder, their wealth continues to increase because they are the ones who benefit from the enormous advances in automation and efficiency already achieved. Those who prosper in a society ought to support the people that are part of said society that enabled then to build such enormous prosperity. Yes, that does mean they need to be taxed more, and continually so. Consider it a tax on utilizing our society's achievement as their primary mechanism of gaining wealth. If we don't start to take the income inequality issue seriously, then we're doomed. What happens when the amount of not yet automated unskilled jobs is small, and the skilled jobs require intelligence and education that only a small portion of the population can achieve? Do the wealthy contribute to build capital? Probably not. There will be a tipping point before then, and in the best case it will result in a revolution. In the more likely case, greed will keep things as they are, and consumers will die off, literally, until there is no more revenue stream into businesses and we collapse. It's simple, really. As society advances so that it's increasingly less reliant on labor to generate greater capital, we need a system to allow that society to benefit from these advances as well. The best way we have for that now is through increasing taxes on the beneficiaries of our societal advancements to support society. Eventually we will need other strategies, but those can be saved for another post. Instead, however, we're doing the opposite of what will strengthen our country. People are without a job or with poor paying jobs because they aren't needed anymore. Nearly all of them are trying to achieve something that we're making impossible. We're reducing health-care support resulting in widespread decline in health and increasing debt, trapping people where they are, and death, the ultimate destruction of potential. We're taking funds away for education. This doesn't just trap the poor. Remember when I said that the workforce will require increasingly out-of-reach skills/intelligence? How will truck drivers get education to train for new jobs when trucks drive themselves? How about coal miners? Instead of investing in those who need support so that they can eventually continue the advancement of society, the elite class of society today doesn't care that their greediness today is continually decreasing our future potential.

The way they approached John Kasich and told him that if he agreed to be the runningmate he could actually run the government, it's clear that Trump has never had any intention of doing the real work. He wants a COO to run operations, and he will play the role of CEO and set the overall agenda and greenlight the moves. Kasich turned that role down, but there's no reason to think someone else isn't doing it. My guess is that Priebus, Bannon and Pence are all jockeying to fill that power vacuum. At the moment the indications are that Bannon is winning. It's the Apprentice.

Muscles_McGeee	politics	1	-1	-1	2017-04	1491336823	I believe the Republicans found Obamas bill to be an overreach as it gave power that the FTC has to the FCC, namely the ability to enact broadband privacy laws. Therefore the Republicans voted to repeal it and transfer regulatory power over the ISPs from the FCC to the FTC. This move makes sense because the FTC is already in charge of Internet privacy regulations, while the FCC is not. As to why it was prioritized I can only assume to repeal the bill before it went into effect.

This is all without publicly executing every officer for the Confederate forces, which they probably deserved and would have sent the message that rebellion is not okay.

Most of the time you really can't, but there might be casual Republicans who see the story in their feed and without my comment would not see the side of reality, but only the propaganda post. For example, I recently did respond to a guy who went on a rant about trying Obama for high treason because of his colluding with Democrats to take down Trump. So, I tried to explain that what he is talking about is Republican propaganda because Trump is in serious trouble with his Russian scandal and he is deflecting/distracting. Will that one guy change his mind? Probably not, but maybe other people who see it will just realize that dude was a crazy conspiracy theorist. Without my response, it would just seem like the guy's speaking true.

At the same time that Bill was illegally going into polling places, she was silent and didn't endorse the candidate that closely aligned with her on policy. Sanders lost Mass by 16,000 votes, allowing the shitty news cycle to continue the ""he doesn't have a chance"" rhetoric and destroying his momentum. Her endorsement would've been a huge boost for Sanders in new England, and she chose to sit on her hands and wait for a winner to surface. Sanders polled +10 to +13 against Trump in the crucial states Trump won against Clinton. Instead we got the status quo candidate that voters saw as indifferent to their suffering on election day, and the rest is history."

You made it and I support your choice, because we live in a country that allows that. Ok, moving on. Trump hasn't *technically* committed a crime. So yes, there will be no impeachment. Democratic politicians are crying like little bitches and need to stop. He's has however done what Hilary has done, towing the line of legal and illegal as close as possible. Maybe he won't fuck up, maybe he will. Honestly, my money is on he will. Because.... well, can we be honest for a minute? Yes? Great. Trump is a fucking ignorant lunatic. Let's not pretend like he isn't. He's an extremely clever and charming bullshit artist, BUT that doesn't mean he ISN'T a raging narcissistic lunatic. Because he is. And if you don't believe me, please, please **please** read the transcripts of some of his non prewritten speeches. Read them word for word. **please**. Again, I'm not at all downing you for supporting trump. More power to you I say. But for the love of god, read what the man says and think about it.

Lying about a consensual BJ was the only thing, in all that time, that they could make stick. Bill got impeached but kept his job as president. Nothing happened to Hillary. Monica has had many good, productive jobs. Google her, look at Wikipedia. Newt Gingrich lost his job as speaker of the house. When you think of all the people the Clintons have worked with over the years, people who are supposidly covering for them? You want to know what the chances are of all those people keeping these secrets and not taking for all those years are? Just look at what's happening to Trump, right now. People saw him doing these things, witnesses telling all. All his lies are coming back to bite him in the ass.

1	Except that the reason Trump's tax plans fail is obviously because of dems in congress and Obama's run has fucked things so much even our great god daddy, or whatever those guys call Trump, couldn't save it	RSRussia	politics	1	-1	-1	2016-11	1478249877	"I think I see what you're trying to say, and I'm all for people earning, renting, whatever. But the GOP plan is *always* ""tax cuts for the rich and business owners, then those people will use their extra money saved to hire new workers, thus boosting the economy."" Problem is, the rich don't do that. They hoard and hoard their money (with exceptions, Bill Gates and George Lucas are extraordinarily generous with their fortunes), and don't give anything back. Meanwhile, while the rich make more and more, the overall tax burden shifts over to the middle and lower class, where wages have stagnated under GOP lead governments, while the cost of living continues to rise. But the GOP just starts yelling about abortion, the gays, and how the dems want to take all your guns away (guess what? We don't), and the uneducated, religious lower class only vote on the *social* issues, and definitely not the *economic* issues, where they are voting EXTREMELY against their own best interests. Everytime a Democrat is POTUS, the economy gets better. Everytime a Republican is POTUS, the economy gets worse, usually affecting the middle and lower class the worst. My hope is that if Trump actually does win, his catastrophic economic policies will finally, FINALLY get the middle and lower class social conservatives to realize that they've been used by the upper class GOP to get richer, just because they yell about God and guns. The GOP doesn't really care about abortion, or same sex marriage, or anything like that. It's all just a part of their smokescreen to blind people from the real agenda buried in the tax plans. It always is. Sorry about the rant, just wanted to vent my frustration with the people around me."

He walks away relatively unscathed while those under or around him suffer, while he declares ""the other"" to be at fault (F. Nations, Scots, Democrats, frickin' windmills).

0	Good point, his latest tweet validates your theory.	shortfox	politics	1	-1	-1	2017-02	1486476194	I've said it before but it bears repeating: Trump does not distinguish between the Presidency and his business empire. To him they are one and the same now. In his mind the US has been **added** to his business empire. That's why he sees no problem in promoting his golf courses or hotels in his capacity as President. That's just some cross-promotion between his different brands. That's also why he will never divest from his company. He probably thinks the people who ask him to do so lack business savvy. He may not even understand their request at all. Trump thinks he cannot have conflicts of interest because he does not see the distinction between his roles. Trump attempts to *run* the US like his company too. The concept of the large and hugely compartmentalized system that is the US administration is alien to him. In his own company he was the boss - the dictator. What he said happened. Whoever stood up to him or contradicted him was fired. He never had to consult with experts or various departments. He never had to broker deals between different factions either. He could always do as he pleases. And if some endeavor or other failed - as they so frequently did - No Problem! He just moved on to a different one. If the US goes the way of Trump Steaks, it won't be *his* problem. That happens in business. Some businesses fail. Whatever. Trump may say and do a lot of thing that are clearly fascist but he's not Hitler. Trump doesn't have an ideology. His souffleur Bannon does but Trump does not. He simply views the US as another business asset. And he'll be damned if he won't make money from the US. Because that's what smrt businessmen do.

SkyFreighter	politics	1	-1	-1	2017-04	1491615343	"My theory on the situation at hand (again just a theory not proven to be factual): Trump and Co. are very close to Russia and Putin (evident since the campaign and probably stretching back before the campaign - see Manafort, Stone, Flynn, Nunes, Bannon, Prince, and now Kurshner). Putin wants the sanctions on Russia lifted. Russia most likely has leverage on Trump and the rest of his administration. Putin tells Trump to attack Assad even though Russia is allies with him. Putin tells Trump which airfield to attack. It is quite obvious this plan was not Trump's (all through the campaign he said he would not get us involved in Syria and he criticized Obama severely over talks of getting involved without congress - something Trump has now done himself). So, Trump called Russia to tell them to get their people out of there and Russia shared the information with Assad (remember they are allies). So, we bomb an empty airfield (one of several at Assad's disposal) in response to chemical attacks against civilians (the same civilians Trump denied as refugees - so no, he doesn't care about them). Russia saber rattles saying they are close to war with USA unless the USA shows a sign of goodwill (lifting the sanctions). So, Trump gets to say he did something ""good"" by keeping us out of war with Russia (one that would have never happened - all Russia would have to do is release its blackmail of Trump if he refused this plan and Trump and Co. would go down with the ship) and Russia gets what it wanted all along - no more sanctions. In the end, this was smoke and mirrors from Russia to lift the sanctions. This is now just another campaign promise Trump failed to uphold."

It would carry into the presidential election as well, which would be a bad thing. He already instructed the DEA to back off of busting dispensaries and they basically told him to fuck off. They've already accused him of exceeding his authority on numerous occasions. Hell, how many times has the GOP tried to vote Obamacare down? They won't even let him choose a Supreme Court justice based upon a load of bullshit. And yet, we expect him to make a sweeping decision without any backlash. Honestly, I am happy he fought for healthcare over weed (and I'm trying to open a business in the industry) because it impacts more people and it was hugely needed. I still have hopes he does something as he leaves. I know it may be a pipe dream, but we've got to get the industry away from being cash-based as it encourages robberies and endangers employees. It's coming. I know we want it now, but once November hits and all these states vote on legalization, California is the key, we're going to see major changes.

Now, there is a portion of our country that feel public education is indoctrinating children with ""Liberal Ideologies"" and that colleges are stripping god and conservatism out of the students. The far right leaning in our country are embracing ignorance over education. They feel global warming is up for debate. They feel progressive social programs are what is killing our country. They feel these ""liberal"" institutions are no place for their family members. Now, we have a nominee for secretary of education that: never attended a public school, never sent her children to public school, is in favor of gutting public schools for charter schools and private schools, believes we should be, ""expanding god's kingdom"" in our schools, believes that guns should be allowed at schools to protect us from bears, is a billionaire that donated countless millions to Trump's campaign, and whose brother (Edgar Prince) is the head of Blackwater and is advising Trump. The future of our country relies on a strong, healthy, educated citizenry. The cabinet picks that have been put forward by the president elect show that he and his cabinet of billionaires want to keep us weak, poorly educated, and without a means to help our sick and enfeebled. We are citizens. We have rights. We have voices. We should not tolerate this nonsense in our country. If you feel that these nominees are unfit for their positions, I urge you, write to your senators and let them know."

If we send the message that we can torture and get away with it, we open the door to more of it. We should absolutely have prosecuted.

We are far removed from the idealism of the Founders. ""America"" has become a composite of jingoism in which the fabric of the Flag has more importance than what that flag symbolizes. Great America is a social construct that never existed. ""America"" became a world power by amassing great wealth by depopulating the Western Hemisphere of its indigenous population opening up vast resources, making use of those resources by exploiting slaves, indentured servants, and immigrants who were welcome to build railroads but denied a place in Great America. America wasn't a world power until the 20th century. Blacks were enslaved until 1863. Even then, Great America denied former slaves a place at the table and even now, huge disparities exist. Women didn't get the right to vote until 1920. World war 2 and the FDR era was arguably America's finest hour but I doubt Trump supporters harken back to a time when America was at its socialist apex, a legacy that the GOP has been trying to dismantle since Reagan. It goes on and on. America great again obviously means a return to when everyone knew their place. A time when a teen aged kid could be murdered in cold blood with impunity for flirting with a white woman. A time of lynching and terror. Separate and inherently unequal. This election was the last gasp of American White Supremacy. Nothing matters more to White America than the preservation of their privileged position. Even the poor want to cling to their ever diminishing piece of the pie and rather than try to exact more of that pie from the 1%, they are entirely more likely to side with the 1% to carve out their piece at the expense of others just based on race or nationality. Corruption? Who cares. Build the wall and give us our share and make America Great...Again."

There is an additional carrot we don't know about and it should be troubling to everyone. This is literally a back room deal that benefits the rich and Trump's image at the cost of the American taxpayer. Does anyone really think that Carrier would agree to stay unless it was well compensated (beyond the 7 million that was previously offered and rejected) for doing so? They would have had to net more than the amount they would have saved in moving the 1000 jobs to Mexico. There is definitely more that is not being disclosed. The CEO would be crucified by the shareholders otherwise.

I'm trying to wrap my head around it and all I can come up with is laziness. Too lazy to do a tiny bit of research about a ""chemical"". Too lazy to read a label. Too lazy to clean up for the health inspector or follow OSHA rules. ""Inspection overkill""? You think too many inspections and GMOs are the reason our food is crammed with criminal amounts of sugar and sodium and marketing materials are allowed to be completely misleading? The FDA isn't the problem, they're the only thing slowing the bleeding. If only they had more power to hold greedy conglomerates' fangs out of our necks.

Without being able to prove, in a civil court, that DJ 'Tiny-Hands' Trump said what he said ""with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not"" and with the intent to mislead the Public, there really isn't a case. Further; as a person in the public-eye, Obama has considerably less right to protection from defamation."

Climate change is a PHYSICAL problem, it is a political one secondarily. This means that you solve it by doing what is PHYSICALLY necessary to solve it, not what is politically possible. And that if you do less than what is physically necessary, you will not solve it Let's say you have a 500lbs barbell sitting on the floor and you want to lift it above your head. Let's say you are a reasonably fit and strong young male, around 6'. You will not be able to lift it (the all-time world record in the Clean &amp; Jerk in the superheavyweight category of Olympic weightlifting is 266kg). Your 10-year old little sister will not be able to do it either. Now, of course, you are much stronger than your little sister, but that is irrelevant when it comes to lifting 500lbs -- it is far beyond what either of you can lift, and both of you will be crushed equally badly under it. Same thing with climate change -- there is no adequate solution to climate change that does not involve the complete dismantling of the world's socio-economic system, moving to a steady-state economy, drastic reduction of population, and so on down the laundry list of complete non-starters. Do you see any politician acknowledging that reality? No. Which means that the difference between Mike Pence and Obama is insignificant compared to the difference between Obama's policies and a realistic policy towards sustainability issues, of which climate change is only one of a number of converging crises (at this point the world is past the all-time peak of conventional oil production, for example). The denial of the left is just as strong as that on the right. The right deludes itself into thinking there is no crisis, the left deludes itself with fantasies about green growth.

I didn't much care for Clinton's attitude towards Bernie supporters, and millennials in particular. I didn't think there was anything that could convince me to vote for her, and I was seriously considering a third party. But then Trump just got worse and intensified his display of abhorrent behavior, and I realized that in my opinion, it was more important to try to stop a Trump presidency than what hurt my feels. That's not to say I think she is the perfect candidate, and in another election, I could absolutely see myself abandoning her. Things like the email server and allegations of impropriety do bother me, but not as much as a candidate that abhors human and civil rights of minorities, a category under which I fall. I cast my ballot for Hillary on Monday a couple hours after early voting began in Texas. There was no hesitation, and I have no ragrets.

Hydrok	politics	1	-1	-1	2016-12	1481714353	"Bernie Sanders was criticized by some Democrats when he said that we shouldn't vote for a Democrat candidate just because they're a minority. We should also vote for a Democrat candidate based on what their policy ideas are and whether they are bought by corporations or not. He was criticized for saying that, and the people who criticized him are the people who think identity politics is more important than anything. So much so that they think we should just support any minority Democrat running for office regardless of their policy ideas and ties with corporations. Many people who have critiqued identity politics like Bernie Sanders are not saying we shouldn't have any identity politics, but that we shouldn't put it above everything else. We shouldn't lose sight of everything just to praise the alter of identity politics. It is possible to juggle multiple values at once. No sorry we shouldn't be that narrow minded, and if that makes us ""anti identity politics"" or racist or sexist or whatever bullshit you want to spew, well then so be it. Many people don't want corporations controlling our government, and no we aren't okay with it even if the politicians being controlled are not white males."

Intelligence briefings can confuse a person. They can overcomplicate a situation and blur the original picture of what you are trying to achieve. They can even prevent new ideas from emerging. I think intelligence briefings should be used like news you are reading daily: You should be aware of things happening, but you shouldn't focus on it too much otherwise you will lose the plot. Personally I feel better about a POTUS who uses his analytical abilities, rather than be swayed by a large amount of data, to drive policy. Keep in mind also that many of these intelligence advisers have agendas of their own and confirmation bias. They will repeat thesis to confirm their own beliefs. It's a little bit like in the old days with the advisers of the king. The point is...Keep them at arm's length but do not over-rely on them. This is not what strategy is about for anything (ruling a country or a company as a CEO)."

The masses have been white middle aged christian men and women. The demographics are changing, and thus the tyranny of the masses is being corrected. You are seeing very spirited debates in the realm of human rights w.r.t LGBT, the ongoing battle against racism, gun laws, etc... All of the unreasonable things that were legislated upon in the past due to tyranny of the majority are being looked at again. Now what happens when a population who has traditionally received whatever it has wanted for the past 100 years suddenly... doesn't? They stamp their feet and cry like little children. That is exactly what is happening now as each of their terrible policies are being backed into a corner that they can't escape from.

But if we start factoring in the context, then of course it is unlikely. As something like this has never happened before.

Further down the scale you've got people who believe some or most industries should be nationalized, but that the entire economy doesn't need to be planned and that there's some room for capitalism (in movies and music, for instance). At the end you've got communists who believe that capitalism is out and out bad and should be replaced entirely by a centrally planned economy. Is he a communist? No, of course not. Is he a socialist? Yes, he's a democratic socialist.

RenaldoTohee	politics	2	2	0	2016-09	1473386292	"I don't believe this, but the logic is that Chris Wallace moderates their Sunday morning political show where he at least attempts to be a straight news guy and Rachel Maddow editorializes 5 nights a week in a decidedly liberal manner for her self-titled show that really makes no attempt to hide its bias. Now, taking off my ""This is what *they* think"" hat and putting on my *this is what I think* hat... Maddow would do a far, far superior debate compared to Wallace. Maddow is just more professional, smarter, and all around better equipped to moderate a discussion and I think she has the ability to turn on her journalism-mode and do a really good, thorough, tough, fair interview with anyone. In a similar thought, I think Jon Stewart would be an incredible debate moderator. In fairness to other networks, I think Anderson Cooper does reasonably well and I think Shep Smith is pretty good too. Megyn Kelly is not my favorite but wasn't bad. I don't think having a known, expressed opinion would make you do a worse job, but I think people categorize the hosts as either journalists or editorialists, and they don't want someone who acknowledges their bias to be the moderator."

When the Bible was written, those practices were not as abhorrent as they are nowadays. That was the way things were back then. Not saying it's right, but that's the context. Besides, rape and wanton killing has been used in war in every culture following any religion or no religion at all. Once you put the Bible in its proper context - a document written by many men during many years with many different messages, around give-or-take 2500 years ago - it becomes less shocking. It's, for all intents and purposes, a historical document with a lot of religious reasoning in between.

The reports themselves, like the Jay report, repeatedly state that there is no evidence that the social workers or the police chiefs were afraid to tackle the issue due to fears of being called a racist. That talking point comes from 1 or 2 officers who were interviewed for the report, instead of from an overwhelming number of police officers and social workers. The reason the police did not treat the issue as severely as they did, is because the police were involved in the abuse themselves. There were police officers who sexually abused the girls. And the way the police officers viewed the vulnerable girls was as trash, unworthy of police protection, as always lying etc.

Now there are an estimated 500,000 illegal immigrants making their way into the US from Mexico each year. So assuming the wall is 100% effective then after 7 years it would have prevented around 3,500,000 illegals from entering the US. That's around $14,000 per immigrant you keep out. Finally the Centre for Immigration studies estimates a net government deficit of $2700 per illegal household, assuming that is 2 people then you're looking at spending $14000 to prevent a deficit of $1350, given the on-going cost of maintaining the 100% effective wall, you are looking at 21 years before breaking even assuming nothing else changes.

Meanwhile, issues like healthcare, workers' rights, drug policy, even foreign policy are being swept under the rug. All because this identity-politics, surface-level circus is good for everybody on that thin upper-crust of society. I personally think Democrats are going to be hard-pressed linking many Republicans to Trump through these ads, as Trump has made it pretty clear that he's the right's anti-establishment candidate.

He was talking about how the media continues talking about how Trump didn't pay taxes and how the media isn't talking about the real issue, which is the problem with the tax code. It completely reinforces the fact that the wealthy in this country DO NOT pay their fair share. The tax code is set up in such a way to benefit the wealthy (exactly what the Left has been saying) and it's not Trumps fault that he takes advantage of it and pays no taxes. While there are serious problems with the tax code, it directly benefits the wealthy, which is why it will never change. But now the slimy Right is using the shit tax code as justification for why Trump and the other wealthy people in this country do not contribute their fair share.

The ""economic recovery"" went to the top 1 percent mainly. And his foreign policy is terrible. Foreign leaders think Obama is a weakling because he won't put his foot down. I don't mean bombing every one you see, but if you say you will do something, as a world leader you do it. Obama said that he would destroy Assads chemical weapons if he used them, and Obama wimped out. Assad still has chemical weapons. And the Iran deal is at Least a partial shit show. 150 billion goes to a Theocratic regime on top of the ability to have nuclear reactors. Iran has been funding Hezbollah and Hamas, terrorist organizations which attack our allies, like Israel and the FSA(moderate rebels...sort of). And that money is going to the Houthis in Yemen, who another ally, Saudi Arabia(yes I get Reddit hates them, but on geo- political basis they are a much better ally. They control a significant amount of oil, and influence upon Sunni states, who make up a supermajority of Muslim countries) is now fighting in a proxy war. Btw, the Houthis are Shiite Islamists, not a secular, or socialist, or nationalist, or democratic movement. Obama has been a pretty bad president who is economically incompetent(the best thing he did is Obama care, and I admit, not bad.

Second, if the inverse was true and the economy had stagnated or gotten worse, Republicans would be hammering it over and over again.

Blacks ARE more criminal than white if you look at incarceration rates or violent crime rates, for example... Per capita they are much more criminal (and violent for that matter.. less than 10% of the population commits over 50% of the violent crime). Is the question asking just who is more criminal or is it asking if it is genetic? Because if it's asking who is more criminal (who commits more crime) then knowing that the answer is black people according to FBI stats isn't racist. You can argue why that is.. is it because of racist laws or racist policing in general? That's a case you can make.. but just knowing the stats as they are isn't racist.

First of all, the ""sex tape"" isn't her. It's been on Snopes for days since your alt-right goons tried to smear her with it. Second of all, so the fuck what if it was? Do women who make adult films surrender their right to have a voice? How much of a woman's clothes have to come off before she becomes ""disgusting""? I guess it falls somewhere between ""bikini competition"" and full frontal. Does her behavior after she worked with you retroactively make it okay that you called her ""Miss Housekeeping"" and publicly humiliated her? If you've ever watched porn in your life, sit the fuck down. Third, Hillary didn't help with shit, and she didn't need to, because Alicia's story would've been just as important if she were not a citizen. I cannot wait for this election to be over.

If I make $39K per year, and get a $5K deductible then instead of paying 25% for being in one tax bracket, I pay 15% for being in the lower one. There is no way to pay 0% income tax.

When I was graduating HS and heading to college it was Bush, which at the time seemed to me, as a young person, a legitimate person to disagree with - his administration clearly lied to the American people, we were getting involved in two wars, he economy was sucking ass by he end of his administration... So my question is, why are young conservatives so angry? Maybe its bc i'm left-leaning, but I don't really get their gripes with the current government.

The only way to do it is through criminal charges. One of the first things Bevin did after being elected was to drastically cut the size of the state's ethics committee. They previously had only 2 or 3 employees. Now it isn't even one full time employee. Since then he has made drastic cuts to education, even though technically that is a role for the state legislature. He has fired the board of two of the state's biggest Universities and replaced them with Republican business owners (Papa John is now a member of the board at the University of Louisville). He is rolling back Kentucky's Medicaid expansion - even though 25% of the population of the state are on Medicaid. He closed the Kentucky state ACA exchange - even though it was hailed as the poster child for how ACA could work. He is on his way to being another Brownback. But he is beloved by the Christians because of his strong stance against gay marriage. Remember the whole Kim Davis thing? The Kentucky county clerk that refused to sign marriage certificates for gay couples? Bevin simply removed the County Clerk's signature for the marriage license process. And Christians love him for that. I guess to Ky Christians, not having good Christian County Clerks sign gay marriage licenses was more important than their poor family members from having access to healthcare.

LebirtandJuztiz	politics	3	3	0	2015-12	1449353755	"GOP ideologues are only intent on ""replacing every word"" of Obamacare so they can erase the President's name from it and claim credit. The truth is that most of of its parts are overwhelmingly supported by the public. Existing conditions? Medicare savings? Insurers must spend 80% of premiums collected on actual health care? No claim denials based on health history? Who in their right mind wants to get rid of those things? Not to mention increasing the deficit and stripping 16 million people of their health coverage. A more rational approach would be to identify specifically what they don't like and offer a plan to improve those aspects. Ryan also has no credibility on this. This is the guy who wanted to eliminate Medicare and replace it with a discount coupon that would have covered about half of the average retiree's private insurance premiums. Those that could get it that is."

These same people see massive budget deficits and a large percentage of revenue dedicated to paying interest on Federal debt. Even at historically low rates, this is unsustainable. It's potentially catastrophic in high interest rate environments. Plenty of people support Trump because they believe he can get America back on the right track financially. It is crucial to understand their logic, even if you disagree with their conclusions. But no, anyone who disagrees with you politically must be a racist bigot.

Bernie obviously has the passionate base, and the youth vote. Are you not concerned that if Hilary beats Bernie in the primary, you are going to alienate that youth vote, and Hilary won't be able to motivate people to go out and vote (not losing the election to the republicans, just not motivating her base enough to win)? 2. This election seems to have 2 narratives. One is the standard Democrat vs Republican, but the other is establishment vs non-establishment. I think what a lot of Hilary supporters are missing is that a lot of people feel VERY strongly about voting in a non-establishment candidate. That means that if Hilary comes up against Trump, you may lose votes not because of his policies, but because he is not an ""establishment"" candidate. I think this feeling is very strong in the youth, and unless you nominate your own non-establishment politician (Bernie) you put yourself at huge risk. Basically, those voters happy to vote in an establishment politician are more likely to fall in line and vote party lines (no matter who the nominee) than those who are angry at the political system and want SOMEONE different."

That seems to be a large part of our problem as a country. It's happening in both parties. The leadership positioning itself to out flank the voters, if the votes cast don't go the way they like. If Clinton or Trump wins the nomination by popular vote they should represent their respective parties. If they don't have the support, then they should not. It's all fairly simple, until someone sticks their fat, dirty fingers in the pie. If and when the parties subvert the will of the voters they should expect the consequences. Those consequences may be minor or may just destroy the party's as we know them today. It looks like the GOP is more likely to fracture as of now. There is already a deep divide within the party. Some of the more conservative members have been revolting for some time now, but either could suffer from bad decisions.

Think about it, you have both sides that end up not wanting to lose their candidate so they vote for their candidate rather then against. Strategic voting would work if you had a small instance of it happening, but on the grand scale voters would much rather vote their candidate in than possibly lose them by voting against their other candidate.

I absolutely hate the fact that we're still acting like little tribes marking our territory by pissing on trees. IMO the nation-state model of the past is far out-dated. We just need to change our culture so we can accept that. It only really serves to prop up the upper echelon of each separate country. Don't worry, we're slowly yet inexorably moving towards it. With the advent of mass worldwide communications and the newer advent of the internet we are going to move more and more and more towards a homogenized culture. Abolishing borders now would definitely not be a wise move though, I do agree with that. But some day.

1	lol, McCain Republicans are just chomping at the bit to be reminded of Palin	Lost_city	politics	2	2	0	2016-04	1461009134	If it becomes an open convention where the delegates are actually free to vote for anyone, the two names the GOP will likely gravitate too will probably be Romney or McCain. And maybe both. Both have national name recognition and aren't really bloodied in this election season. If the GOP really wants to reenact their 1912 debacle, then they need to know they are going to lose the Presidential race. And Romney or McCain would be best positioned to help defend their control of Congress. Of course, this is all predicated upon the GOP going into a massive Convention fight logically.

If the USA dropped 1000 bombs, does it really matter if Canada drops, or doesn't drop one more? No, I think Canada could be better used in other ways.

1	Its her turn.	CuzWutDoINo	politics	3	3	0	2016-07	1469219397	Very succint and well put. I will say that I do think people underestimate the amount of time and work she has put in. I am not a fan of hers or her cabal of women she keeps around her but.... That being said, she has been working and working hard in Washington on behalf of the people for many many years. She has a husband who was president and she remained in the core of washington since he left. So she more than likely has made some friends and more than likely a lot of people want to see her as president. Not because all of them are greasy snakes who just want to fuck America any chance they get and help wall strett etc etc But i think a lot of them believe she willbe a good president and that she has earned it. It is very easy to say as an outsider that Bernie is the best candidate but honestly. Bernie supporters have known him for what. A year. Hilary has earned the respect and trust of her peers in washington and the DNC. They dont know Bernie and dont know what he is really all about. So while its not perfect, it is certainly not just some big conspiracy to keep Bernie out. It really is about Hilary being in line for this job since Bill left. What i really dont like is that this shit reeks of a Monarchy where you inherit the positions of powers because you were born into the right family. BUt if you forget about Bill and just focus on how long she has been in Washington and the amount of work she is done. It is easy to see why the DNC wanted her.

Maybe we just didn't drink the Sanders koolaid. Or maybe we got tired of the same old rhetoric from his fanbase. Or maybe we realized he can't control his campaign staff during a primary, why would he be able to do it during a general election? Or maybe he was asked softball questions constantly and the few questions that should have had substantial answers were answered with ""meh"" from him and his campaign.

Evergreening (the acts of taking out another 20-year patent on a drug by changing nothing in its efficacy in order to prevent generic manufacturing) is strongly protected, and the rights of pharmaceutical companies take precedence in this trade agreement against a nations own IP laws. At a time where Big Pharma seems to be price-gouging out of everyone they see (and incidentally sharing one the largest profit margins of any industry), the TPP does no favors in getting us affordable medicines, especially when basic science and R&amp;D is funded through tax-payer dollars.

Rome is 6 hours ahead of EST so he won't be done with the debate till 5am there. The best travel time to JFK (no traffic) is 34 minutes according to google maps. It is now 5:34am in Rome. The quickest flight time I can see from a quick google search is 8 hours and 35 minutes. This brings us to 2:09 pm in Rome. Assuming no traffic from the airport there to the Vatican it is another 29 minutes of travel, bringing us to 2:38 pm. He is set to speak at 4:00 pm. All of this does not factor in the time to actually leave the debate following it ending at 11 pm, traffic in either city, the debate running over even by a couple minutes, or any potential delays in either location. Even in this best case scenario he shows up at Vatican City with 1 hour and 20 minutes before he speaks. And the likelihood of there being zero delays is slim to none. The debates have almost always run over. And the candidates usually linger to talk to reporters, supporters, shake hands. He for sure won't have time for that. Zero traffic in two major cities, especially leaving a large event in one is also very unlikely. All in all it just seems like a really tight schedule for 10 minutes of speaking. And not to mention the cost of chartering a private jet since no flight leaves in an acceptable window for this trip for him.

I'm a pretty big free market guy and am a libertarian but I will say this: It's a hell of a lot easier to add taxes and regulations on than it is to take them back. Gary Johnson agrees with Bernie on ending the drug war, ending crony capitalism, fixing rigged politics, and they share a lot of the same principles in terms of foreign policy. Where they differ in on fiscal and economic principle, but a lot of Bernie people, I think, should be open to Johnson's moderate libertarianism and the belief that government can only create a level playing field and that when government tries to fix all of these problems, things become more complicated, inefficient, and more costly. So let's walk this mile together, ending corruption, ending the drug war, and becoming a more free society with less government intervention. Choose your own social principles and the government will stay out. Everything passed will be done legally and constitutionally with no executive actions or loopholes. After we walk this mile we can branch off in other directions, but Trump and Hillary are not going to do the things that either of us want to accomplish. So let's walk together, and you can always add on more tyranny later if it doesn't work out.

That is not how this day and age works. Furthermore, these are not exactly secrete speeches either. Just a few month ago, taking money for wall-street is just par for the course. She did not even try to hide it, until Sanders made it an issue. So I don't think security was really tight at those events, someone has a recording of it on their cellphone. If the 47% comment got recorded speaking to that tiny group, her wall-street speeches got recorded for sure. It's a ticking time bomb. And we all know what is in those speeches. It's nothing criminal, or sinister. But it is going to be friendly. She is going to thank them for supporting her campaign. Thank them for the contribution they made to the economy. And show that she support free market ideals. All of these things were mainstream and uncontroversial 3 month ago, when she was planning to run against bush who would have said exactly the same thing. But it is not 3 month ago, and it is not Bush. It is Sanders and Trump, and both of those will crucify her for those same remarks. It is only a matter of time before this bomb blows up in her face. The only difference is it blows up in favor of Sanders or Trump.

But, how many other women are in the establishment? Clinton got in because of her husband (which shows the sexist nature of the system). We need a system reform so that we can get more outside presidents and don't have to wait an eternity for the next woman president.

However, here's a really ugly scenario: Sanders wins the nomination and ISIL or Al Qaeda pull off (or even attempt to pull off) another attack on US soil this year as US intelligence is warning, the conversation immediately shifts to foreign policy and defense and Bernie immediately gets eviscerated by even the weakest republican challenger. And that's how easy it is for the next 4-8 years to be the complete undoing of even the most modest steps the left has been working so hard for. My opinion: this generation of whiny millennials deserves it. They need to feel what eating real shit feels like. They need to feel the consequences of their actions.

But he also knows that the internet does a lot of the work for him. Take it how you will, but Bernie has really done an artful smear... Smear is perhaps the wrong word due to it's connotations. But it's a very artful strategy.

All over this subreddit, i see nothing but young people saying they can't make it to a caucus because they gotta work... I mean... REALLY!?! You can't schedule a day off in several months in advance, can't get someone to cover your shift, or just call in for ONE DAY!? Its that inconvenient for you that you're just not gonna vote for the one person in this election that has your best interests in his mind? The cynical part of me wants to just say that all the people who say they can't afford to call in for a day are the same lazy slacks who are a hair's breath away from being fired because they've missed so much work or just don't do their job anyway and their boss is looking for an excuse. I don't want to believe that but christ almighty its HARD when i see how low youth voter turn out is. There is literally NO excuse for this. But oh well, to all the young millennials who want to bitch about how bad its gonna get, if you didn't vote SHUT THE HELL UP, you had the best chance to make a real change here but couldn't be bothered to sit in a building for a few hours.

I fully support the idea of a third party, or even that and a fourth party. The problem with out present system -- which is especially relevant to this election -- is that if none of the candidates get a majority number of electoral votes (50%+1), then the House elects the POTUS from among the 3 top-scoring candidates. In other words, should Johnson or Stein do especially well (together or individually) and take away a majority win for either Trump or Hillary, then the House (controlled by Repubs) gets to decide between them. Until we fix this part of the process (I wonder about the viability of the Electoral college &amp; their voting process in general), then the introduction of a viable third party only ensures that the House gets to pick the President every go around.

Stability is a desirable outcome, one that helps everyone. If we had the establishment constantly being overthrown, or as Jefferson said a revolution every 15 years, it would be almost impossible to do anything in this country. You couldn't plan for retirement, hold a steady job, or be confident in your personal safety. The question is to how much do you prefer establishment power over those other virtues. It amazes me how short our memories can be. We very recently had a popular movement that did great damage to establishment power--the Tea Party. They proceeded to remake the Republicans entirely and were well on the way to even greater change before we stopped them because they were crazy. The balanced budget amendment was a super duper anti-establishment push that would have appealed greatly to popular will--but it was a terrible plan and stopped it. The establishment isn't evil by nature, and populism can be absolutely terrifying. I'd like to know why you feel that our system is not representative, fair, participatory, and competitive. In my eyes, the Tea Party proved very recently that the system is all of those things.

That's too many people.* Basically he's saying *25% of the people in this state have no other options for healhcare than Medicaid, so I'm going to take it away.* My girlfriend works in Elizabethtown - at the Community College even - and all her coworkers were Bevin supporters. They all have family members who are on Medicaid. They all work in higher ed. Bevin ran on a platform of taking away Medicaid and making huge funding cuts to higher ed. These people still voted for him. Why? Because they thought it was shameful the way that Kim Davis got treated for standing up for her Christian beliefs, and Bevin promised to fix that. He took County Clerk signatures off of Marriage Licenses. Literally he just revised the forms without a place for County Clerks to sign. That's it. So these people literally chose to elect a person that would take their family members' healthcare away AND put their own jobs at risk, just so Kim Davis and people like her wouldn't have to sign marriage licenses for gay people. Almost 200 people have been laid off from the Community College system so far and there's probably more cuts coming this fall.

0	So Detroit is to blame for being inhuman cunts, and Flint is to blame for negligently failing to test and treat the backup supply.	cuntcuntcucunt	politics	8	8	0	2016-01	1453409538	FWIW, this guy is correct. Flint City Council voted 7-1 in 2013 to stop using Detroit water and instead switch to KWA regional water supply. Flint's mayor approved the action, and so did the Emergency Manager. Ending the purchase of water from Detroit was not a controversial decision - pretty much everyone in Flint was on board. But it didn;t go as planned, largely because Detroit decided to screw Flint. When Flint voted in 2013, the KWA regional water system wouldn't be ready for years. Flint wanted to keep buying water from Detroit until KWA was ready and they could then switch over. Instead of allowing Flint to do that, Detroit told them no, screw you guys, we're terminating the contract, here's your one-year notice. That meant Detroit water was cut off to Flint in 2014, well before the KWA water supply was ready. Left in the lurch, Flint was forced to use the long-designated back-up water supply, which of course was the river. Again, though, that decision itself is not the problem. Even if it was, Detroit essentially forced Flint's hand by cutting off the water earlier than Flint wanted.

JojenCopyPaste	politics	1	1	0	2016-01	1453485178	I can tell you that my union, IATSE, decided to back hillary by a unanimous Eboard vote.

I believe in the future, they may consider polling the membership because now they're in a tough spot. 85% of members polled (after the endorsement was made) support Bernie. If the leadership ignores that, the next union election will go poorly for them. If they change their endorsement to bernie, but hillary wins the nomination, they'll be in her doghouse. Their best bet is to stay the course and try to appease the membership somehow. Or wait until bernie is clearly in the lead and change their endorsement then.

CharlieDarwin2	politics	2	2	0	2015-11	1448813116	"Jason Chaffetz, Carly Fiorina and the Republican Party owe an apology to Planned Parenthood and the American People for fomenting hatred and inciting violence against the organization. The language that Republicans have employed against Planned Parenthood over the last several weeks has been appalling. They have falsely accused the organization of being at the center of an illicit industry focused on increasing the number of abortion procedures in order to profit from the sale of ""baby parts"". Even if that language did not directly lead to the violence that was recently perpetrated against Planned Parenthood, it is only a matter of time before this language *does* directly inspire such violence. This is the type of language that fascist dictatorships use to foment violent action against their political enemies. Worse still, most of the Republicans employing this language lack the conviction of their words and are merely attacking Planned Parenthood in order to further their political careers. If we as a nation can't demand and receive an apology from these demagogues, as well as assurances that they'll stop attempting to terrorize their political opponents, then we may as well pack up. Because a two-party system can't last long where one of the parties starts to use pogroms and assassinations as legitimate tactics and no adults in the room stand up and call them out on their despicable and cowardly bullshit."

Who cares if they believed a convincing video saying PP sold baby parts? At least they are standing up for the ones who can't stand up for themselves. They stand up for the innocent. The unborn children don't have voices so someone has to speak for them. Someone has to stand up and defend their right to live. All the while they get mocked. An abortion is the killing of a human. I could care less if they are selling the parts or not. Abortion is the most evil thing in the history of the world. Millions upon millions of defenseless babies have perished without a say in the matter. I know it's hard on the single moms and that bringing a baby into the world would be very very hard. But there is no justification for the murder of an innocent child. Even if that child would be autistic, crippled, or in a terrible situation. Everyone deserves the chance at life, to experience laughter and joy, and even hardships. There is something very wrong with a world where wrong is called right and right is called wrong.

While she was an Ambassador to the UN at this time, this isn't an area under the Secretary of State. Instead it's a cabinet level position directly under the United States. I'm not trying to be a Hillary shill or anything either. I legitimately am looking for examples of when Hillary publicly said anything about the video/attack.

Alexi_Strife	politics	0	0	0	2015-10	1445023248	"To the Bernie fans out there: I am not predicting the Sanders campaign is going to fall apart. It is still early and there are still more debates to go. That said, if it does, I have an appeal for you. Don't accept the status quo offered by Clinton and the Democrat establishment. Many of you got behind Sanders because you think radical change is needed to save this country -- and I think you are correct. But, as Sanders says, he isn't the one who would be creating radical change, it was always going to take millions of people engaging in direct action all over the country. So, even if Sanders loses, please consider engaging in such mass direct actions. Consider working with radical socialists, anarchists and activists in this country who are trying to engender a political revolution themselves as we speak. JFK once said ""Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable."" You Bernie Sanders supporters are trying for peaceful revolution right now. If you can't get it, please consider working with those of us who have given up waiting on peaceful revolution, and are now instead advocating for violent revolution. Your instincts that revolution is necessary and possible are correct -- but if the means you were attempting to use (the vote) is not working, please don't give up on the goals you were correct to have."

1	Totally simple!	TCMMT	politics	3	3	0	2015-03	1425838940	The electors in the electoral college vote according to whom they have pledged to vote for: determined by the popular vote in either their state or congressional district (in Nebraska and Maine) Statements like this reek of complete ignorance of how elections actually work in this country. Here's how the electoral college works: The people vote. The vote in each district are tallied up and a winner of each district and/or state is determined. Depending on the state either the overall winner of that state gets all of that state's electoral votes, or the votes are split between candidates based on how many districts each of them won + 2 electoral votes determined by a statewide election (this is only done in Nebraska and Maine). The president-elect is the candidate that wins the absolute majority of electoral votes (currently 270). If no candidate wins a majority of the votes, the president is selected from the top-three candidates by the house, and the VP is selected from the top-three VP candidates by the senate. The house has selected the president twice: once in 1801, and once in 1825. The senate has selected the VP once in 1837. If the House is deadlocked and unable to make a selection, the VP becomes acting president until they are able to do so. If Senate is similarly unable to select a VP, the Speaker of the House becomes acting president according to the order of succession until a president or vice president is selected. This has never occurred. It is illegal in 24 states for an elector to either vote against their pledge or to not vote. These are called faithless electors and have *never changed a presidential election in US history*. tl;dr When you vote for president, you are voting not for the president, but for an elector that has pledged to vote for the particular candidate you think you've voted for. If the popular vote didn't matter, presidential candidates wouldn't spend billions of dollars campaigning publicly. Is the electoral college a perfect solution?

Liberal ideology has ALWAYS been focused on one central tenant: maximum individual freedom. The differences between classical (Smith/Kant), Social (what in America is called modern (Keynes/Roosevelt)) and Neo (Reagan/Thatcher) rest in how that was achieved. Classical Liberals believed in obtaining this freedom through minimal state control of individuals lives: removing barriers to individual choice was the best way. It was a reaction to monarchy and aristocracy. Social Liberals believed that all this freedom talk was irrelevant if you were trapped in poverty with no social mobility, so they devised the welfare state. They believed freedom was only achievable if everyone was able to start at a level where they were able to make decision without fear of starvation or dying to preventable diseases. This was a reaction to the unregulated liberal ideas that lead to the Great Depression. Neo-Liberalism WAS A RESPONSE TO THE WELFARE STATE IN CRISIS. After the Oil Embargo in the seventies, Neo-libs claimed that state interference in the economy would cause dangers to those who relied on state welfare when said economy was downward trending, making the state unable to maintain said welfare. Thus, the welfare state had structural limits on potential freedom. This is a VERY basic description of liberal history, but it has to keep being reiterated that liberalism has always had freedom as its central guiding philosophy.

1	Just like some people are born evil - amen!	Inexpliacbly	politics	1	1	0	2015-04	1430220073	Ehh, seems to follow the exact pattern of the London riots a few years back. Ideologically motivated, justified, and peaceful protests that are quickly followed by an almost entirely different crowd motivated by opportunism to run riot and steal whatever they want. They see the protests as a sign that the Police can't possibly catch everyone or be everywhere, and so no-one can stop them, and so do whatever they think they can get away with. Honestly you see the same thing on a much smaller scale every day. People are often more held back by the thought that they can't get away with something than they are by morality or the idea that it'd hurt people they don't know. Of course, in London the riots were followed by much larger crowds banding together to clean up the mess and destruction, to support those whose lives and businesses were destroyed, and to condemn the actions of a relative minority of selfish opportunists hiding under the banner of a cause they don't understand or care about (check out those interviews with some of the London looters, if you want to see what I mean. Just using some overheard misunderstood ideological cause as an excuse to do whatever they want, eesh).

0	Have a nice day, Jesus.	upnorthgirl	politics	2	2	0	2015-04	1430437740	"The Democratic party's extremism on abortion can be their down fall. I visited my cousin a while ago and went to a Catholic church in his area. There the church has a nice flier that explained confession and identified mortal and venial sins. Among the mortal sins was ""voting for a pro-choice politician"". I wonder what will happen if Hispanics are offered an alternative, and if this alternative makes sure to explain just how extreme the Democrat position on abortion really is? You don't have to be religious to be against the Democrats' position on abortion, but it would certainly help. And Hispanics are more religious than whites. The Democrats' position, legal abortion without any restrictions all the way through the entire pregnancy, is morally wrong. Evil, really. Gay marriage just might flip more towards 55 to 60% against if the left doesn't stop itself from going after churches, such as the Catholic church, that will not cave and instead stick to scripture. The point is that a good number of minorities who are against abortion and who are against gay marriage currently vote Democrat. There's obviously opportunity there for the GOP to greatly reduce the Democrats' margin of victory among those groups. Both of those issues will not be completely going away in either of our lifetimes. **Especially** abortion. School choice, opposition to abortion, and a simplified tax code are examples of issues the GOP can win voters who haven't traditionally been GOP voters with. Democrats are generally opposed to school choice because of their ties to the unions, they are against any restrictions on abortion because of their ties to Planned Parenthood and other pro-abortion groups, and they want to increase the revenue base (especially with taxes on the rich)."

Corporate fines are meaningless. The only solution is revolution. I don't say that lightly, but it is past time. How does that happen? In other countries, social media works. Here, complacent very busy people don't even bother to vote. The key? The young people here, fed up with corporate and religious right control. So, damn it, get involved.

I interned with higher profile campaign during the midterms. I won't say specifically what I was working on, but we were testing out some interesting things in anticipation for use in 2016. Suffice to say classic neighborhood canvassing is out in favor of a fully targeted mobile system that has more information than you could imagine about individuals and neighborhoods as a whole. There will be multiple teams of social media ""gurus"" staffing an office 24/7 scouring the internet for anything relevant (positive, or negative), and then pass along the interesting stuff to ""friends"" (read:well disguised bot army, or shill groups if the bots aren't good enough) that will share content on every social media site. Oh, and promoted content galore - yet it will be fairly inconspicuous. No, the super annoying tv attack ads aren't going away just yet. But remember - they aren't designed for you. Their only purpose is to rile up the low-infos and 65+ retirees. So they'll still be scaring grandma and grandpa like old-times. What's really going to interesting to see is if their ideas for reaching the millennial and younger crowd actually work, and not get tuned out like in years past. It'll probably end up being another lame attempt at rock the vote - which haven't really worked as of yet, obviously. final note - There's definitely a need to manage a candidate's appearances a little better. Jets are a pre-requisite for POTUS campaigning - however, they were misused last time out. Re-fuel stops in various towns were packaged as a ""pep rally"" but were nothing more than boring 45 minute speeches from local pols followed by a 5 minute canned speech from the candidate that everyone there had heard before. Anyway, I've typed far more than I had intended - apologies! Oh - **disclaimer** I'm not pretending to have super secret intel straight from the DNC/RNC.

First, Obama's policies and bills boosted the economy and had a direct impact in the reduction of net job loos which lead to net job gains. This has been studied and verified through the peer review process. Second, Republicans kept spouting that Obama would make the economy worse and everything Obama has said directly proves his critics wrong. So I agree, just because something happened while you were president doesn't mean you get to take credit for it, but when you can point to legislation and initiatives that do have a causal affect on an outcome, then you certainly can.

But you can just imagine the amount of screaming and fallout from republicans shouting about how the law is being used to suppress elected representatives, and what not, and the media will have a field day.

I'll only add: As to the mention that no motive holds up under scrutiny, this is never an element of any crime and quite frankly, is irrelevant as to whether a crime was committed. While it appears that some of the best evidence is circumstantial, please understand that any fact can be established with purely circumstantial evidence. Too much Law and Order reruns have made people believe that circumstantial evidence is worthless. It is not. As to the lack of physical evidence. This is the same as circumstantial. There is no obligation to have physical evidence. A crime can be proven by one witness who gets up and states for the jury that she saw the whole thing. This would not be physical evidence and, if the jury believes it, is enough to establish guilt. Ill part with this: if there had been a serious violation of the defendant's rights, it would have been explained by the Supreme Court on review last term. Even if the defense attorney does not raise it, the court themselves may bring it up. Had any other legitimate argument existed, other than the 8th Amendment argument, it would have been raised by the liberal Justices. Sorry. But this man is getting an injection...

SicInOmnibus	politics	1	1	0	2015-05	1430962465	See, here is the problem. When an organization does something heinous like this and a lawsuit ensues, it is the taxpayers who foot the bill. The money does not come out of the budget of the organization responsible, the individuals are rarely adequately punished, and there is no real incentive to never do it again. The only way to stop this is to put the pain where the problem is. If a law enforcement organization loses a lawsuit, that money should come out of their budget and no, they don't just get to ask for more to cover their cost. If they have to sell equipment and lay people off to afford it, then that is what they do. If they lose so many lawsuits that they can't afford to operate any longer, then they shouldn't continue to exist anyway.

0	Zombie Reagan 2016	j_la	politics	1	1	0	2015-09	1443455593	I have quite a few relatives who lean hard Right (one of them writes-in Ronald Reagan on presidential ballots -- not kidding) and I hear their position described every Thanksgiving and Christmas (in between telling me I'm going to hell for voting Democrat). Oversimplifying a little (but only a little), their worldview is Leave it to Beaver. In 1950 America, everyone knew their neighbor and did their job and went to church and children were polite and you could leave your door unlocked at night. All of that was destroyed by the liberals, with their rock n' roll and Roe v. Wade and Civil Rights. The result was an epidemic of broken marriages and single mothers and abortions and drugs and welfare and bad language on TV and gang wars and pornography and having to explain what a blowjob is to your first grader because a Demoncrat got one in the Oval Office. If you point out the 50s weren't so great for minorities, or that women were treated like second class citizens, or that the world was 5 minutes away from nuclear war on any given day, most of them won't understand what you're talking about. However, the more reasonable ones might agree, but ask whether there must have been a way to address those problems without turning America into *Caligula*. IMO, the title of this post misses the point. For many on the right, it has less to do with taxes, unions, and the size of government. It has everything to do with the culture. Just my 2 cents.

The fact that he doesn't think it is a right you are entitled to does not mean that he doesn't believe an employer shouldn't be able to offer it if they see fit. I can, to an extent, see why one would believe that a large business should provide this benefit. They can afford to do so and continue business. But this can be crippling to a smaller business. Say you have 5-10 people working for you and a single person missing time is a significant detriment to your business. They can leave if they need to, and you can find a temporary replacement. It will still probably hurt your business, but it is managable. Now, let's say instead that you must pay this person throughout their leave. Now, you can't hire a replacement and your production is significantly impacted. I could justify mandatory paid leave to businesses with 1,000 employees, but you stifle small business if you apply it to all employers. The greater the barrier to entry in creating businesses, the less competition there will be, and we all suffer.

I quit after 3 months when I learned that my co-worker, who had been there for 2 years and got promoted to a managerial position in the make-up department, was only making something like $6.30/hour. This was in 2006. I'm convinced CVS is corrupt from the top down, because everyone else I know has had similar experiences with low wages, wage stagnation after promotion, and wage theft.

0	By the sound of it people spread republican viewpoints pretty hard peer to peer.	leoberto	politics	2	2	0	2013-10	1381483500	Of course. It seems fairly self-evident, but I'll elaborate. In the past, when there were only three networks, a few influential newspapers, and most ordinary people had no mechanism for broadcasting their views.... the people with resources could easily and effectively reach almost everyone without having their views challenged. In today's world, there are thousands and thousands of sources, and even the lowliest amongst us has the ability to be heard. Humans are a skeptical bunch by nature, we get advertised at, we get sold to, we get brainwashed, we get coerced. But the thing we listen to and take the most seriously is our peer network. If our closest friends believe in something, we are almost certainly going to give that belief serious consideration, even if we've seen millions of dollars of advertising saying the opposite. The entire planet is now connected, forget the Internet, just by pocket phone, to every other person on the planet by some very small number of degrees of separation. The speed and efficiency of peer-to-peer information sharing puts over-priced commercial spots on 60 minutes to shame. The 1% have seen the writing on the wall for a while now. They are losing control of people, and they know it. I mentioned Egypt. There is a perfect case study. Forget the 1%, that country was completely and totally run by one man. Every ad that ran on TV was for him. Every single one. He had a secret police infrastructure that disappeared dissenters. He was above the rule of law. And then one cell-phone video of a kid in another country lighting himself on fire goes viral, and everything he spent all his money on goes up in smoke. Guys like the Koch brothers are the last gasps of a dying breed. They exist in the one demographic that still hasn't discovered the joys of the democratization of information... old conservatives. They are spending more and more for less and less effect, and will have flushed it all down the toilet before too long. It's obnoxious and frustrating and annoying and we all just wish they'd go away, but in a decade or two, theylll be gone, and things are going to get better.

Mitt Romney is an intelligent man, no doubt. But I really don't believe he's ever fully perceived why that tape was so damning. He was speaking to a private audience of multimillionaire and multibillioniare donors. His people. The home crowd. These people paid *$50,000* ***per plate*** to sit in a room with Mitt Romney for a couple of hours, more than many Americans will *earn in two or three years of full time work* just to have their egos stroked and their biases and senses of superiority over all other Americans to be reaffirmed.

Notice, Mitt didn't speak about abortion, no flags and eagles, no talk of a ""Constitutional Amendment to Ban Flag Burning,"" or ""gun rights,"" or any of the usual canards. Those are wedge issues designed to appeal to rage rather than reason, which has been instrumental to the American Right's success in recent decades. Mitt told his audience what they wanted to hear: a message of Social Darwinism. It's funny how many religiously continue to vote for those who regard their fellow men as chattel for exploitation."

Seriously, any one who needs to carry his weapon EVERYWHERE in public has some major screws loose in his head. As I remember it: There was a movement a couple years ago in California to expand Open Carry, they had a big gathering in the South bay ( I think it was Manhattan Beach or near there) one guy was carrying a pistol with a magazine in the weapon (which was against the CA Open Carry law). A police officer approached him to ascertain if the weapon was loaded or not. He and a few of his friend got belligerent, more cops were called in before things settled down. After some one finally got the idea for this guy to remove the magazine and show the cop it was unloaded. I think this guy was given a ticket for violating the law but not quite sure. Anyways the police union reps got involved after the local cops complained, state reps heard it loud and clear from the anti-open carry people and the police unions and months later the Open Carry campaign ended with no more open carry in California.

Poverty - Increase the poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you provide everything for them to live. 3. Debt - Increase the debt level to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes and this will produce more poverty. 4. Gun control - Remove the ability to defend themselves from government. That way you are able to create a police state. 5. Welfare - Take control of every aspect (food, housing, income) of their lives because that will make them fully dependent on the government. 6. Education - Take control of what people read and listen to and take control or what children learn in school. 7. Religion - Remove belief in God from the government and schools because the people need to believe in only the government knowing what is best for the people. 8. Class warfare - Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. Eliminate the middle class. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to tax the wealthy with the support of the poor. It should be clear to all how our nation is well on its way to winning its race to the bottom. Is it our public servants in both political parties who are constitution-despising oath breakers? Or, we the people who vote and revote them in office to sell us out?

0	What do we do when prices rise without increased demand?	ratatatar	politics	2	2	0	2014-09	1410196245	The GOP's argument never has been that subsidizing healthcare for the poor will not give healthcare to people for a lower price. It is that the healthcare prices will rise following the increase in demand for medical services, driving up prices of health care, which should in theory drive up health insurance costs. (A large jump but a jump that has been made). These increased health insurance costs will be covered by further subsidies and the growth in subsidies will become unsustainable. Whether this argument is true or not is clearly up for debate, and will be decided as time passes. With that being said, this article misses the point. Most conservatives agreed that healthcare would be offered to more people at a lower cost in the short run. Anyone who denies that doesn't understand basic economic theory.

She's certainly earned her shot at the presidency once again, and it's a great reminder that federal governance is not the sole domain of rich, white WASPy men.

That's why they carry. It makes them feel more powerful and more above others.

The insurance adjuster who denies a claim because of a typo on an irrelevant part of a form is doing her job, moral or not. And she doesn't go home and deny care to her children or her family, because she's not a bad person. As for 'allowing corporations to exist', who can stop them?

Not anything I would qualify as ""Generous"""	milessycamore	politics	1	1	0	2014-11	1416347070	Not really. First off gross profits are only the first stop on the income statement, as they don't include wages, overhead, taxes, or anything else that costs the company money to operate. Net income is literally all that the company has left after every expense had been deducted from revenue. Usually this number is a rather small percentage of revenue (like 10% is a pretty good number). So 4.5% of that is not very bad. So yeah, it's less than a penny of every dollar of gross income, but gross income is a bad measure of how much money the company had available to spend on charity (or anything else not related to operations).

If the United States were kidnapping entire weddings or funerals, and beheading the attendees one at a time to persuade some group to turn over the one or two people we wanted, the United States would be guilty of comparable brutality. As it is, the comparison is warranted, and reminds us we should continue to work on more surgical methods of getting at the one or two people we've targeted, but it only serves to confirm that ISIL is unique in its brutality."

Glblwrmingisfak	politics	3	3	0	2014-05	1399330440	That retired cop in florida has some bad ideas about when it is justified to use lethal force in self defense. Too much time on the force with poor rules of engagement and virtually unlimited immunity for mistakes. Cops scare me, I don't trust them, and I definitely don't count on them to protect me. That is the kind of person the anti gun people want to have a monopoly on the legitimate use of force in society. Scares the shit out of me. He is going to prison for a very long time, unless his buddies can somehow get him off, which I doubt. That isn't a statement on concealed carry, cops are allowed to carry guns virtually everywhere, even where concealed carry is prohibited for average citizens like in the most populous areas of CA. About guns in bars, why do you think a sober designated driver, bartender, or bouncer shouldn't be allowed to carry a gun if the property owner allows it? It is still and always will be up to the property owner, but shouldn't they be able to allow it if they choose? There are plenty of studies which show allowing law abiding citizens to carry guns reduces violent crime and murder rates in that area, and most importantly it allows people to protect themselves, a fundamental right.

Papa John's, Olive Garden and Red Lobster have already lost many customers and profit over this and had to reverse this decision and are scrambling to regain market share. Let me put this as plainly as possible. If you are in the food service industry and you advertise that you are going to cut your workers hours so that they won't have healthcare coverage, you are going to LOSE CUSTOMERS!!! Permit me to explain why: they are announcing that their employees won't have healthcare coverage. And that means that their employees probably won't be able to afford to go to the doctor when they are sick, so they are more likely to get diseases that get worse even though they could have been cured with antibiotics or other proper medications covered by a healthcare plan. So they are letting us, their potential customers, know that their employees are more likely to be spreading contagious diseases as they prepare and serve our food. Thanks for the warning. I guess I won't be going to your restaurants anymore. At least until you change your policy so you won't have sicker servers/delivery personnel and cooks than your competitors. And because they are cutting their employees' hours they will need to hire more part-time workers who also have no health care but who do have new germs to share to take up the slack. On top of that, customers don't want to frequent companies that don't look after the well being of their employees and even make announcements of how they are going to screw their workers over like the aforementioned restaurants. Personally, I'd gladly pay a few bucks extra to know that my server and the cook were reasonably healthy and didn't infect my meal. That is true for anyone who understands the germ theory of disease or has an ounce of empathy for the people serving them. In a few weeks or months we will read how Wendy's has lost a ton of business just like Papa John's, Red Lobster and Olive Garden did. Truly monumentally stupid!

The word ""Satan"" literally translates to ""adversary"", and is used by LaVeyan Satanists with a sort of loving cynicism, and playful admiration for the character and what he represents; its a jab at judeo-christian religion, not the literal belief and worship of a mythical figure. There are a lot of over the top rituals and theatrics, but its really just pomp and circumstance with a sexy/""evil"" paint job; and an attitude of, ""Punch their face."" rather than ""Turn the other cheek."" Granted, there's a lot more involved, but I'm trying to simplify. tl;dr LaVeyan Satanists are basically spooky, theatrical, atheistic humanists, who use the word/character ""Satan"" with cynicism; an ""Adversary"", to represent and encourage indulgence in human vices and behaviors (ie; ""sins""); while christianity and ""God"", represent abstinence and repression of our human behaviors/desires."

The reason this myth holds so much traction is that economics 101 largely ignores the way the real world works in favor of actually teaching you the basics of the theory. It's doing physics without gravity or friction. When the middle class is healthy, we're *all* better off. When the middle class is healthy, we land on the fucking moon.

0	maybe they will go out of business for spreading ebola.	fingers	politics	2	2	0	2012-11	1352739793	I have worked at restaurants for years and this is a pretty common practice. Restaurants can also raise the amount of hours you need to qualify for insurance then restrict the amount of hours you can work. This action doesn't surprise me but it does make me sad. By the way, sick people will always go to work at restaurants, I can remember having one person with a cold one week then 80 percent of the staff getting a cold the next week (stay away from lemon in your water servers often use bare hands to reach in and ad this to your drinking glass and hand washing is not a normal proactive among many staff members). When we were sick we often told people we had allergies to avoid any serious questions from customers. We, like most people, could not mis work (not being able to afford it) and no insurance or sick days to pay for it (if we were allotted sick days they were a fraction of what we would make per hour and did not really benefit us financially.) As for sick days, many are hired on as part time as most working shifts are 6 hours (labor laws in California so I can not speak for all restaurants every where). A six hour shift avoids the complications of lunch breaks and breaking labor laws as well as avoiding offering health insurance and benefits. Total number of hours you can work are now reduced to 36, working 6 days a week 6 hours a day. The staffing is also limited as hours count against the establishment so calling out sick often negatively impacts the restaurant (staffing, service, and customer satisfaction) and reflects poorly on you as a server which can impact the shifts you are scheduled which impacts the money you will make. Hope this is clear.

Killing 3000 Americans on American soil is one thing, and apparently American foreign policy demands that we give the House of Saud a pass on that, but if they've got an entire group of insurance companies on their asses in court they've dun goofed hard. Would it not be tragic and amazing if a lawsuit over insurance settlements put together the links between the Saudi Royal Family, Israel, the PNAC, the Bush Administration, and the 9/11 hijackers? I've got a feeling the insurance cabal will not accept the whitewashed version of events that was offered to the American people by the 9/11 commission. They've got real money tied up in this.

That is all that is needed from the opponents on the system, no arguments just ask Why, why now, how much, and what will be lost.

It taxes you because you need to pay your share, not because you drove a car or bought a pillow.

Here's a common list of historical revisions popular amongst white supremacists and reddit: * The Civil War wasn't about slavery. This one is easily disproven by reading the articles of secession from any of the states that seceded, the Confederate Constitution, or Confederate VP Alexander Stephens' Cornerstone Speech, which all state in no uncertain terms that their ""nation"" was founded on the idea that the black man is inferior to the white man and that his place is slavery. * Black people sold other black people into slavery. This is not exactly a lie, but it's used without context to paint a different picture than the reality, which is that there was no reason for solidarity between those selling and those being sold because they were prisoners of war, not, like, the sellers' family or neighbors or something. And it ignores that chattel slavery is significantly different from the slavery that came before it in that there were few means of obtaining freedom, you were treated like livestock instead of unpaid help, you could be sold apart from your family, and you could be born into slavery. It also ignores the fact that white people didn't have to buy slaves. They could have gone to the market and said, ""Nah, man, we're cool."" The idea that there were black people involved in the slave trade is thrown around to absolve white people--even the ones literally responsible for chattel slavery--of any guilt. * The Irish were slaves too. Again, factual but not indicative of the whole picture. The Irish were not part of chattel slavery (as they were not considered the ones being punished by the Curse of Ham). There were Irish indentured servants and slaves, and this was obviously still wrong, but they were held under the conditions of classical slavery rather than chattel slavery, and when they were freed, they eventually came to be considered white. There are more, but those are the ones you'll see around here the most."

0	For the folks at the bottom, a 13% sales tax is pretty much effectively a 13% income tax simply because they spend their entire income.	willcode4beer	politics	1	1	0	2013-02	1360198839	"No, regressive taxes such as sales tax always hit the lowest income brackets hardest because their discretionary spending is so much less. As you move down the income spectrum, discretionary spending power reduces much faster, until it hits zero around poverty-level incomes. Even though a middle class family with $10,000 of discretionary income will pay more in sales taxes than a low income family with $500 of discretionary income, the lower class feels it much more because a budget 1/20 the size cannot absorb the change and/or makes substitutions to lower-cost alternatives. So, you are correct that more of this tax will be paid by the middle class than lower, but the lower class will still ""feel"" this change the most."

They're for inconsistent applications of laws: big businesses get tax breaks that aren't available for small disruptor businesses. Atlas Shrugged, as individuals so often quote in the Republican party, is anarcho-capitalist in which contract law is the only law, and perhaps there is an unspoken moral deontology but it's not an enforcible thing. If there is a government, it is only to ensure the proper execution of contracts. None of the Republican ideologue have lead me to believe that is what they want.

Canada_girl	politics	1	1	0	2013-02	1361902140	I totally agree, but I get frustrated because most people I know vote for one of the two corrupt parties instead of for a decent person (Ron Paul or Dennis Kucinich would've been ok, too), and there ARE decent people running for a lot of positions, including president, that never get elected. Many voters knowingly vote for corrupt people, and then when things go wrong they blame corporations, etc. when they knowingly played right into the corporations' hands, often helping to market that corrupt candidate for the whole election. I have a hard time taking complaints seriously from people like this. I'm not necessarily saying you're one of those people, but if you voted for Barack or Romney or promoted them, you are. Unfortunately, we both know nothing's going to change soon because people are easily controlled and effect of the media (one of the tools of those in power) isn't easy to overcome. Also, people aren't very smart. Democracy is a decent form of government, but it's not perfect.

Snap65	politics	6	6	0	2012-03	1331969577	"AFAIK, you don't need to show a passport to pass through a TSA checkpoint (security), even when you are flying out of the US to another country. A driver's license should suffice. The purpose of the checkpoint is only to verify your identity and other security theater, not that you have sufficient documentation to get to your destination. It's the job of the staff at the check-in counter to check that you have a passport with a valid visa (if required) to get to another country. Staff at the gate usually ask to see your passport as well for the same reason. In most countries other than the US and Canada, passengers flying out of the country have to pass through an ""emigration"" booth, where immigration officials stamp your passport and check that you have not overstayed your visa (if applicable and you aren't a citizen). Even in these countries, I do not think it is their job to check that you have the correct documentation to get to your destination. I fly out of the US all the time, and have never shown the TSA my passport. It's none of their damn business when a driver's license is enough."

1	Knock her up and then give the kid up for adoption?	fatmama923	politics	1	1	0	2013-10	1381998379	"My long-time girlfriend/fiancee/whatever is in this ""donut hole"" gap. She works part-time at a retail shop while working on her master's degree and trying to progress her research interests. She suffers from a couple of preexisting conditions (mental and physical) that shut her out of affordable healthcare once she turned 26 and was kicked off her mom's plan for ""aging out."" These conditions have hurt her academically, socially, and of course, medically/psychologically, and being utterly unable to afford to do anything about it has been awful. Because she needs to focus on academics, a full-time job is very unrealistic (although she's applying for them now just because of how strapped we are for cash). While I have a full-time job, my employer doesn't subsidize spousal insurance rates (so it's only $25/mo for me to have full coverage, but adding her would raise the monthly cost to $650), and my own salary is too low to pay for her to just have normal insurance while also supporting her tuition and our basic living expenses. We don't have cable, rarely eat out aside from the dollar menu or coupons we find, have cut down our cellphone usage, and we've cut almost all ""luxury"" purchases in over a year. I'm a hardcore gamer--well, at least I was. The last game I could afford to buy was SimCity 5. . . well, that sucked, hah. She's an avid reader, record-collector, and fashionista. . . she's re-reading textbooks, listening to Spotify, and wearing clothes almost as old as our 10-year relationship. Nonetheless, Obamacare and our home state have screwed her out of the prospect of insurance. Because she earns less than $11,500, she isn't eligible for *any* assistance. My salary and hers combined would be high enough that--if we were to get married--we *still* couldn't afford to get her a plan because the tax subsidy given to us would be too low. Either together or apart, we are too poor to give her healthcare. Instead, she just struggles on, trying to deal with her conditions with little more than the force of will. She can't see doctors or therapists and her prescriptions ran out ages ago. If a flare-up of one occurs, there's nothing we can do but try to ride it out--a trip to the emergency room uninsured would put us so far in debt we'd never claw out of it. ----- Frankly, both parties are at fault for this. The Democrats failed liberal constituents by bargaining down from true universal healthcare for all and making enormous concessions to the insurance industry--a group of companies who have no reason whatsoever to care about the lives of their customers. Money is what drives and feeds them, and they will receive a great deal of it. The Republican legislature and governor here are the ones who elected to reject Medicaid expansion and screw over the state's poor who couldn't even make it into the watered down healthcare overhaul. ---- Know what's the most fun part of this? If I'd just knock her up with a kid we can't afford and don't want, she'd get right onto Medicaid--the perfect example of the Republicans' feared ""Welfare Queen."" So if you're poor as shit and responsible, FUCK YOU NO HEALTHCARE, but if you're poor and bring some kid into your world of suffering and poverty, we'll pile it on for free. I hate this state with every fiber of my being. Too bad we don't even have enough money to leave it."

Bruc3w4yn3	politics	2	2	0	2012-07	1343019402	There are two ways to read the 2nd ammendment. 1: the people in the militia can bare arms. (you need to be in a militia to bare arms) this is what this man says. 2: We need militias, because if this, everyone has the right to bare arms. (in case one needs to be formed, we have armed citizens) the courts have already sided with the latter interpretation. we need armed citizens in case we find a reason to form a militia. the right to bare arms extends to all americans unless they forfeit their right by flouting the law. some Americans think they need to be prepared to fight off the government. The founding fathers had the same thoughts. We should not undermine the founding father's wisdom by eliminating the 2nd amendment. It is 2nd! that makes it more important than the other 8!

1	"Totally all the fault of ""the rich"" and not over regulation and a broke ass banking system both of which encourage consolidation over new growth"	NickRausch	politics	-10	-10	0	2013-04	1365913532	Here is a serious economic issue that isn't often even discussed: We have an upward flow in currency. Over time, money leaves the less wealthy and heads to the more wealthy. Things like minimum wage and high taxes on the rich are supposed to push the money back down. A lot of arguments can be made about interfering in the market and and the Laffer Curve (which I don't think we've reached the apex of, but that's another argument of) and such and they're appropriate arguments. Classical economics, though imperfect, got us where we are now. However, that doesn't address the fact that the issue remains: Less and less money is available to the average person and more and more actual currency is being replaced with credit. Despite the claim that business owners and such will reinvest their money and what not, that's not happening nearly as fast as it needs to. Plus, a lot of money made by the wealthy is through corporate investment. Myriad people who don't actually have any businesses to grow make money from businesses! Further, those people, being individuals who experience the same 24 hour days and 7 day weeks we experience, can't spend and shouldn't be expected to spend a healthy amount of their growing worth. It's also a problem that actual liquid capital (dollars and coins) ends up trickling up into complex and arcane financial entities that are far from liquid... We are suffering from a situation where businesses are becoming unsustainable trusts regardless of law because the law is no longer keeping up with how high-level finance works. The economy is becoming like a Jenga tower: Getting increasingly tall and increasingly less stable and less able to support itself.

I for one am bothered by this, because it's common financial wisdom to contribute to your 401k, and index funds are highly recommended due to the lower expense ratios. Even Vanguard's FTSE Social Index Fund Investor Shares (VFTSX) which ""seeks to track a benchmark of large- and mid-capitalization stocks that have been screened for certain social, human rights, and environmental criteria"" includes JPMorgan, Citi and BofA in their top 10 holdings. So one more thing you can do is find a way to eliminate or reduce your holdings of these companies.

First of all, the fee was I think $33, even on overdrafts of five cents. Second, the bank computer would somehow reorder transactions so that as many fees as possible would accrue. There was a maximum of five per day, but just about anyone who had one fee got all five, for $165. And certainly no one is informed this is happening, or they wouldn't have spent $35 on a $2 coffee. They just find out later when they check their account that they have hundreds of dollars in fees. If they don't notice on the first day, this can go on for days. People will think they have positive $200 in the account because they don't know they've gotten $300 in fees. The fees were ordained by computer whose methods were basically unknowable. All the time someone would call up and say ""why the fuck did I get these five fees"", and I would check their record and I would have no idea why. And I would ask my supervisor and they had no idea, and they would ask their supervisor and no one had any idea. A lot of times, if you processed the transactions in a logical order, the account never would have gone negative. But somehow the computer assessed things in some bizarre order which started rolling the fees in, which obviously contribute to the account being negative. This doesn't happen to rich people obviously. This only happens to paycheck-to-paycheck people who never have more than $1000 in their account. From what I saw, just about no one in America has more than $1000 in their account. We were also pressured into selling ""services"" to people that nobody needed. We got bonuses for ""sales"", and they tried to make an open culture of peer-shaming by posting how many sales everybody had. These were basically tricking consumers into money-market accounts to ""grow their wealth"", while attempting to obfuscate the fact that our ""high interest accounts"" were like 0.5% interest IF you had more than $10,000 in them. This is far less than average inflation of the USD, so really you'd be losing money. Anyway, I knew this place was a bunch of bullshit, so I never tried to sell anyone anything, and for about a month I just refunded every single customer fee before leaving. I got warned by management about my poor sales record and excessive number of fee refunds and I was like ""oh gee, so sorry *i'm leaving*""."

These terms now elicit a knee-jerk negative response from a large number of people who probably aren't particularly unjust or extreme themselves, but rather respond to things emotionally rather than rationally. Rather than argue about what these words 'really' mean, or try to reason with people who work with feelings rather than reason, why don't we just accept that these words mean something new to some people, and use them accordingly?

Congress as a collective has power, and the informed and well networked individuals have the majority of that collective power. Lobbiests have power. Long standing permanent non-elected positions within various government agencies, depending on the agency, have power. The president? Just a figure head, and constitutionally has little power to sway. In the past, usually times of particularly scarring war, great characters rose up and were able to guide the movement of society, but it is a rarity, but they certainly were not alone in their efforts. Presidents do not have power, its a joke the level of stardom they receive in comparison to Canadian Prime Ministers who are almost the sole harbourers of power (when in a majority rule). Plus this government debacle did not start under Obama, it was under Bush. who I have also never pitted full blame against for the greater mistakes under his reign (Most policies of which are continuing under Obama's time in office, not Obama's policies).

People think lobbying is buying politicians gifts and sending them on vacations. That exists and should be heavily restricted, but it isn't lobbying. Lobbying is going up in Congress and giving a speech on a specific piece of legislation. Joe Schmo from down the street can petition to lobby a bill and he'd have the same right and ability to do so as some slimy doublespeaking lawyer. The thing is, Joe has a job, while for the lawyer lobbying IS his job. He can devote all of his time and resources to it because somebody is paying him to do so on their behalf. The ACLU lobbies for and against bills all the time. It's a part of democracy, for better or worse.

1	Yes the race is more important than the relief effort	keslehr	politics	0	0	0	2012-11	1351900366	Maybe because they've trained for months straight to compete in this marathon. Marathoners rarely run more than 2 or 3 in a year, because the training is a very long process, and it takes a large toll on your body. They've trained for months, and they have tapered specifically for this race, with every day's workout leading up to the race being on a certain day. Even delaying the race a week will be very detrimental to their performance. The winner of this race gets $130,000. To most people, that's a pretty big deal, and to be screwed out of it, when the race can be run, is no small thing. When a Kenyan wins a race of this magnitude, they can feed their family for the rest of their life. Others can be using this race to qualify for other races. On top of that, there are many people running for charities. To say the runners should give up what they've trained for all this time and go help out instead is ignorant.

When that federal money is cut even lower (as Gary Johnson wants) then these states will develop huge deficits. When the government does not bailout the states (As Gary Johnson has said he won't do) then they go bankrupt. Jobs plummet, but even worse, the dollar plummets. Remember what happened in the EU and Greece? So to stop the dollar from falling even more, what do you do? Bailout the states, or force them out of the union (Similar to what's happening with Greece in the EU)? But not like it will matter, won't be as many people living anyway with the massive cuts to medicaid, medicare, social security that Johnson wants. Oh yeah, what a great candidate.

So to change it people ought to focus on changing those rules. Anything else is pissing in the wind. Adopting doomed-to-fail strategies will only dissipate our strength."

I don't live in one of those early caucus states but I can only imagine the ads are already constant. I do, however, already see them on youtube and plenty of other sites. Internet ads are really cheap and I'm sure a few million dollars goes a long way there. But I feel over the coming months a tsunami of TV and internet ads will flood all available commercial space and people will only turn to murderous rage against any candidate (Particularly since they will probably be 95% negative). I know some of you will say we've already had annoying amounts of election ads in previous cycles, but the near infinite money supply and short-sighted greed will blow those out of the water. And for my final water-based disaster metaphor, Citizens United will be the sirens that crash our politicians into angry, annoyed rocks. Either that or they will all tear each other and themselves apart by inadvertantly revealing everyone's personal corruptions.

If a retail company is doing more business in China, they may add some support roles in the US, but most added jobs will again be in foreign countries where the sales take place. Service jobs and IT have potential, as do any 'knowledge worker' roles, but it's an area based largely on priority of creativity, learning and education. Something other countries (like China) are investing *very* heavily in... It will grow in the short term, but it's going to need a lot of watering to keep it growing at a competitive level in the long term.

It won't be long before that stops, I guess. These are stories I read, watched and heard in the mainstream media over here: - your political system is one of the most corrupt systems in the world - your politicians represent companies instead of people - your government will probably censor the internet - your government detains without trial - your government tortures people - your government hires mercenaries - your government does nothing to improve education - your president doesn't have any real influence over what happens - your presidential candidates are stupid beyond belief - your presidential candidates promote stupidity - your presidential candidates are not taking seriously over here - your elections are a joke - your media outlets cannot be trusted - your media outlets focus on distractions instead of main issues - your people are fucked when they're uninsured - your infrastructure is collapsing - your economy will soon be top 3 instead of #1 - your economy will probably collapse a second time So it's not only Reddit or The Daily Show that is covering these issues. Other countries are watching and passing the popcorn while your country is collapsing. And I think it will get worse, not better. I am 29 years old and looking back at the world's history I don't think the problems above will be solved during my lifetime. It will probably have to get a lot worse before a movement arises that's big enough to demand real change. Now you'll probably read this, take one small point out of my story and comment on that. That's okay, but please notice the trend of what's going on in your country. Do something about it. We need our big brother to act like role model. Right now he's high as a kite.

0	Do you have a link to a study of rich people not feeling normal empathy?	telavivblackout	politics	2	2	0	2011-12	1324039893	Politicians don't care if you don't like them. Not at all. On the contrary, the realize that they're hated, especially at the higher levels. In fact, I think they're very, very immune to the normal feelings that most humans have. Especially a president. And as rich people (as most of them are) they're likely immune to feeling empathy or sympathy toward other people. Studies have shown that very wealthy people don't feel the same kind of emotions like empathy that average neophytes are prone to. So hate them. I have a feeling they know it and don't particularly care. They're trying to please their corporate sponsors, not their constituents. I have a feeling that lots of Americans feel exactly the same way. Look at the approval rating of congress. They know they're hated more than communism and herpes but what are they doing? THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT THOSE WHO VOTED THEM IN WANT (with SOPA, NDAA, etc) They. Don't. Give. A. Fuck. They don't. I'm not saying your feelings are inconsequential because I don't believe that completely. But I'm just saying you're feeling the same thing everyone else is. Some of us have protested, joined the local occupation, become active in local government with recall efforts, exposing people to the truth who otherwise might not get it and everything else I can to make sure things change. The problem is that Americans want to pull a lever, sit back and wait for positive change. And that's never going to happen. Regardless of who you vote for. Politics in America used to be a participatory situation....people were active, vocal, very, very involved. These days, people post on internet message boards and social networks and think that they've 'involved' themselves with politics. The powers that be stole your country and americans sat back and allowed them to without so much as even standing up against it. 30 years later, the heat is on and people are still just thinking, 'Should we do something about this?' By the time the average american wakes up to what's really going on, there will be nothing left to save.

1	True ... look at how much the Democrats kept them in check, in the past, using the filibuster to their advantage	dgiancaspro	politics	2	2	0	2010-11	1290016506	The problem with changing the filibuster rules is that the Democrats know that they aren't always going to have a majority in the Senate. The cyclical nature of power indicates that some day (maybe in two years) the GOP will have a majority in the Senate. Then the Democrats will have managed to let the GOP pass every piece of legislation that they want.

If nothing else, it seems that the Democrats and the Republicans are far too invested in protectionism and self-survival to be able to represent their constituents effectively. The culture of corruption (earmarks, lobbying, and payoffs) has shown to be too ingrained in these two parties for any politician who seeks their support to be able to act with integrity and in the interests of the people they represent.

A few years ago, the majority of Americans wanted to keep slavery, didn't want women to be able to vote, etc., etc. This just in: the majority of Americans are idiots. (Not in the intellectually-challenged way, but in the don't-mess-with-the-status-quo way.) Thankfully, America is not a democracy -- where the whims of the masses are law. It's a constitutional democratic republic. So, even if the majority wants something fucked up, the elected representatives have a duty to prevent it. This is loudly proclaimed across reddit... except, apparently, when it comes to the particular minority that reddit loves to hate: the wealthy. The wealthy already pay significantly more taxes than the rest of America. This is how a percentage works. And with a graduated tax system, the wealthy pay higher percentages of taxes than the not-so-wealthy (close to, and sometimes above, 50% of income). So, when exactly would you have it stop? At what point do we, as a society, inadvertently take away the motivation that has lead America to excel in ways that no other country does by taking away the potential payoff for entrepreneurial thinking and lots of hard work?

Why do x-rays cost so much? It's the same technology that's been around for decades? Shouldn't it be dirt cheap by now? Same with blood tests? Why are those so expensive? Compare it to the computer industry. A DVD burner used to cost hundreds of dollars. You can get them now for $20. What was once top of the line and pricey is now available to everyone.

My friend on facebook, who was my friend growing up, who never talked about politics growing up, and now only talks about politics on facebook has posted a link to a story about Obama laying off 100,000 members of the military. He made the comment ""President Obama to lay off 100,000 military personnel. Maybe they can collect unemployment. Seems that he prefers to pay people not to work."" My question is don't the taxpayers pay the members of the military's salary? And isn't unemployment paid buy the employer? So basically the tax payer. And am I right or wrong about unemployment being something you only get if you lose your job over something you have no control over? To me it seems like my friend is for tax dollars going to pay the military's salary, but not tax dollars going to pay for them being laid off. The way I understand it if say a person at a factory gets laid off then their employer who laid him/her off is paying for his unemployment, same with the military that his employer will be paying the unemployment, but his employer is funded by tax dollars.

A couple years I was faced with a really hard choice. I had been dating someone of the same gender from Canada for almost 5 years and we were ready to take things to the next level. I knew that if we wanted to be together that we would have to get married (due to immigration laws in either country at the time) but the DOMA would prevent me from sponsering him for immigration into the USA. At that point it was one of two things, get married in Canada and then immigrate, or end the relationship. I felt that my inalienable right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness was being cancelled out by the DOMA and ultimately ended up getting married in Canada and subsequently immigrated several months later. While I know that ultimately it was my choice, I personally felt that it was less of a choice and more of a statement that I was welcome to pursue happiness, though if it was with someone of the same gender that it wouldn't be welcome in the USA. I also believe that America suffered as well, because while I may just be one person, the USA lost a tax payer because of DOMA. I can't help but think that I wasn't the only one.
